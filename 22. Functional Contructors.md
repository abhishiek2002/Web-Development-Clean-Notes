Deliverables


```md
Create a constructor function Person which takes in first name, last name , Sex and age of person
Inside the constructor function , create a function called printFullName which prints full name (first name + last name) of the student
Initialize 2 objects with the following values
"yash", "prasad", 10, "M"
"vaibhav", "prasad", 20, "M"
Minimum age to be egligible for going to disco is 18. Write a function outside the constructor function by which it can be checked whether the given person is allowed to enter the disco or not.


Complete the puzzle. Try it by yourself. It is very easy.

If stuck for more than 1 hour check the hints



Expected Output (case sensitive and space sensitive)

Full name = yash prasad

10

yash not egligible

Full name = vaibhav prasad

20

vaibhav egligible
```

```js
function Person(firstName, lastName, age, sex) {
  this.age = age;
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.sex = sex;
  this.printFullName = () => {
   //complete this function such that it console logs the full name
   //Be aware  - Format should match and case sensitive
      console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);
  };
}

Person.prototype.findegligibleOrNot = function findegligibleOrNot(minAge) {
    //complete this function such that it prints ELIGIBLE or NOT ELIGIBLE based on user's age
    //Be aware  - Format should match and case sensitive
    if (this.age >= minAge) {
        console.log("ELIGIBLE");
    }
    else {
        console.log("NOT ELIGIBLE");
    }
};


function createNewStudents(){
    const person1 = new Person("yash", "prasad", 10, "M");
    const person2 = new Person("vaibhav", "prasad", 20, "M");
    
    person1.printFullName();
    person1.findegligibleOrNot(18);
    person2.printFullName();
    person2.findegligibleOrNot(18);

}
```
