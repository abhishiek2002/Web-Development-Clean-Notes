In this phase, we will focus on inserting sample data into the database and retrieving relevant information using raw SQL queries. By adding users, buses, bookings, and payments, we will ensure that our database has meaningful data to work with. We will also write queries to fetch users and filter buses based on seat availability.

## Deliverables

1.Insert Sample Data

    Add and retrieve add into the database.

2. Implement API Endpoints

User Endpoints:

    POST /users → Add a new user.
    GET /users → Retrieve all users from the database.

Bus Endpoints:

    POST /buses → Add a new bus.
    GET /buses/available/:seats → Retrieve all buses with more than the specified number of available seats.

Check this in postman after done with creating the endpoints:

Fetching Users:

    Write an SQL query to retrieve all users from the database.
    Filtering Buses by Seat Availability:

Write an SQL query to retrieve all buses where available seats are greater than 10.
