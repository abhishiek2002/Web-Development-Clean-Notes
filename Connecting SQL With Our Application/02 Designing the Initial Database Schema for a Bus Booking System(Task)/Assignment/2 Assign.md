## Additional Task:

    Create a new entry in the database with the following details:
    Name: Virat Kohli
    Email: virat.kohli@example.com
    Update the newly created entry by changing:
    Name: King Kohli
    Email: king.kohli@example.com
    Delete the updated entry to verify the delete functionality.
    Ensure proper error handling, especially for cases like trying to update or delete a non-existent user.
    Log all database operations (insertion, update, and deletion) in the console for debugging purposes.
    Manage database connections efficiently to prevent memory leaks and connection issues.
