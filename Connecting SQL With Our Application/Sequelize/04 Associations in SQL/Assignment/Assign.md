In our exploration of Sequelize, understanding associations between models is crucial for building efficient database structures.

Associations allow us to define relationships such as one-to-many, many-to-many, and more, which are essential for managing related data effectively.

To deepen your understanding of associations in Sequelize, please watch the following videos:

## Deliverables:

After watching the videos, please complete the following tasks:

    Implement the One-to-Many association between two models described in the video on your local system, ensuring that one user can have multiple posts.
    Create a controller that handles the creation and retrieval of these associations.
    Write the Sequelize code to define these models and their association.

Once you have completed the functionality, please push your code to GitHub and submit the link to your repository
