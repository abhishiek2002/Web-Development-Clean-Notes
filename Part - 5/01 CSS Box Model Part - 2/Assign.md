You will focus on the following CSS Box Model properties:

```
    Margin ‚Üí Controls the space outside the element.
    Padding ‚Üí Controls the space inside the element, between content and border.
    Border ‚Üí Defines the outer boundary of an element.
    Content ‚Üí The actual content inside an element.
    Box-Sizing ‚Üí Determines how width and height are calculated (content-box vs. border-box).
    Margin Collapse ‚Üí Understand how adjacent margins interact.
```

üìù Deliverables:
```md
Your task is to apply the following CSS styles based on the concepts described below.

1. Create Two Boxes:
Box 1 (.box-1):
Should have margin and padding.
No border should be applied.
Background color: light gray.
Box 2 (.box-2):
Should have margin and padding.
Border: 2px solid black.
Box-Sizing: border-box.
Background color: light blue.
2. Apply Margin and Padding:
Both boxes should have margin: 20px; and padding: 15px;.
3. Apply Border and Box-Sizing:
Only Box 2 should have a border (2px solid black).
Box 2 should use box-sizing: border-box; to control width and height calculations.
```

üìö Instructions:

    Remove any comments and add the styles exactly as described.
    Use the correct selectors (.box-1, .box-2).
    Focus only on writing correct CSS rules in your compiler.


Your final output should demonstrate proper application of margin, padding, border, content, box-sizing, and margin collapse.

This is the desired result:
