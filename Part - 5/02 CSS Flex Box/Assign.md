You will focus on the following CSS Flexbox properties:


```md
Display → Enables flexbox by setting display: flex on a container.
Main Axis & Cross Axis →
The main axis is determined by flex-direction and defines the primary direction of content flow.
The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis and controls the secondary alignment.
Flex Direction → Defines the main axis (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
Justify Content → Controls alignment along the main axis (flex-start, center, space-between, etc.).
Align Items → Aligns items along the cross axis (stretch, center, flex-start, etc.).
Flex Wrap → Defines whether items should wrap to a new line (nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse).
Align Self → Adjusts alignment of a single item within the flex container.
Gap → Defines space between flex items.
Flex Grow, Shrink & Basis → Controls item size behavior within a flex container.
```
