# üìò CSS `position` Property - Complete Guide

The `position` property in CSS is used to control the positioning method of an element in the document. It works with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to define the exact position of an element.

---

## üîπ Syntax

```css
selector {
  position: value;
  top: value;
  right: value;
  bottom: value;
  left: value;
}
```

---

## üîπ Position Values

### 1. `static` (Default)

* Elements are positioned according to the **normal flow** of the document.
* `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` have **no effect**.

```css
div {
  position: static;
}
```

‚úÖ Use When: You don't need special positioning.

---

### 2. `relative`

* Element is positioned **relative to its normal position**.
* Offsets using `top`, `left`, etc., will move it **without affecting** other elements.

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 10px;
}
```

‚úÖ Use When: You want to shift an element slightly from its original place.

---

### 3. `absolute`

* Positioned **relative to the nearest positioned ancestor** (non-static).
* If no such ancestor exists, it‚Äôs positioned relative to `<html>`.
* Removed from the normal document flow.

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
}

.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

‚úÖ Use When: You want to place an element exactly within a specific container.

---

### 4. `fixed`

* Positioned **relative to the browser window**.
* Stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

```css
nav {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

‚úÖ Use When: You want a sticky navigation or sidebar that always stays visible.

---

### 5. `sticky`

* A hybrid of `relative` and `fixed`.
* Element toggles between relative and fixed **based on scroll position**.
* Requires a `top`, `left`, etc. to function.

```css
header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```

‚úÖ Use When: You want the element to scroll until a threshold, then stick.

## üîπ Comparison Table

| Value      | Relative To                 | Removed from Flow | Scroll Behavior    |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `static`   | Default flow                | ‚ùå                 | Normal scroll      |
| `relative` | Own position                | ‚ùå                 | Scrolls normally   |
| `absolute` | Nearest positioned ancestor | ‚úÖ                 | Stays fixed inside |
| `fixed`    | Viewport                    | ‚úÖ                 | Fixed on screen    |
| `sticky`   | Scroll container            | ‚ùå                 | Scrolls then fixes |

## üîπ Visual Summary

```
static   ‚Üí Normal position (default)
relative ‚Üí Offset from its normal position
absolute ‚Üí Positioned inside parent (or HTML)
fixed    ‚Üí Fixed to browser window
sticky   ‚Üí Relative until sticky point, then fixed
```

---

## üîπ Z-Index with Position

* Only works on elements with position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

Higher `z-index` = appears on top.

## üìù Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Tooltip with absolute

```css
.tooltip {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  left: 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Fixed footer

```css
.footer {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Example 3: Sticky header

```css
.header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```

## üìù Conclusion

* `position` controls how elements are placed in relation to other elements and the viewport.
