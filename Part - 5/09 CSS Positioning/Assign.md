## Positioning Property
    You will also learn about different position values in CSS and how they affect element layout:

    Static: Default. Element stays in the normal document flow.
    Relative: Element is positioned relative to its normal position using top/right/bottom/left.
    Absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. Removed from normal flow.
    Fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport. Stays fixed during scroll.
    Sticky: A hybrid of relative and fixed. Sticks at a defined position during scrolling.


## Float Property
    Learn how to use float to align elements horizontally and wrap text:

    Float: left: Element floats to the left.
    Float: right: Element floats to the right.
    Float: none: Default. Element does not float.


### Tip: Use clear: left | right | both to control wrapping around floated elements.
