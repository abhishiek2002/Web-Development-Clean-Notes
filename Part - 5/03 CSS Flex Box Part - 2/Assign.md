What You Will Learn:


Before starting this task, review the key concepts of Flexbox to understand how elements align and distribute space within a container.



You will focus on the following Flexbox properties:

```md
display: flex → Defines a flex container.
flex-direction → Determines the main axis direction (row or column).
justify-content → Aligns items along the main axis.
align-items → Aligns items along the cross axis.
align-content → Controls alignment for multiple flex lines.
flex-wrap → Determines if items should wrap.
gap → Controls spacing between items.
flex → A shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
order → Defines the order of items in a flex container.
align-self → Allows individual items to override align-items.
```

Deliverables:
```md
Your task is to apply the following CSS styles based on the concepts described below.



1. Create a Flexbox Layout:
Container (.flex-container):

Should have display flex.
flex-direction column.
justify-content should be space-between.
align-items be center.
Background color be light gray.
Add height of 100vh.


Flex Items:



Box 1 (.box-1):

Should be centered.
Background color: light blue.


Box 2 (.box-2):

Should be aligned to the flex-end.
Background color: light green.
Add height and width like 250px each.


2. Apply Flex Properties:
Box 1 should be in the center using align-self: center.
Box 2 should be aligned to the bottom using align-self: flex-end.
```

Your final output should demonstrate proper use of Flexbox properties including alignment and positioning.
