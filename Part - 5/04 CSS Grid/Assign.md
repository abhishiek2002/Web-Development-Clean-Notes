You will focus on the following CSS Grid properties:

```md
Display → Enables grid by setting display: grid or display: inline-grid on a container.
Grid Container & Grid Items → The parent element is the grid container, and its children are grid items.
Grid Template Columns & Rows → Defines the number and size of columns and rows (grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows).
Gap → Defines spacing between rows and columns (row-gap, column-gap, gap).
Grid Lines, Tracks & Cells →
Grid Lines: Invisible lines dividing the grid into sections.
Grid Tracks: The space between two grid lines (rows and columns).
Grid Cells: The intersection of a row and a column.
Grid Area → Defines a specific area in the grid using grid-area.
Justify & Align Content → Controls alignment of the entire grid within the container (justify-content, align-content).
Justify & Align Items → Controls alignment of individual items inside grid cells (justify-items, align-items).
Justify & Align Self → Adjusts alignment of a single item within its cell (justify-self, align-self).
Grid Auto Flow → Defines how items are placed in the grid (row, column, dense).
Auto-Fit & Auto-Fill → Helps in responsive design by adjusting grid tracks dynamically.
Fractional Units (fr) & Minmax → Allows flexible sizing of grid items (fr units, minmax() function).
