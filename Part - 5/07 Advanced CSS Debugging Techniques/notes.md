# ðŸ§  Advanced CSS Debugging Techniques

### 1. **Use DevTools Performance Tab**

* Identify rendering bottlenecks.
* Detect expensive repaints or reflows caused by CSS.

### 2. **Toggle Individual Properties in DevTools**

* Use checkboxes to toggle properties one by one.
* Helps isolate problematic styles.

### 3. **Use CSS Logical Properties for Writing Modes**

* Test multi-language or RTL (Right-to-Left) layouts using logical properties like `margin-inline-start`, `padding-block-end`, etc.

### 4. **Force Element States in DevTools**

* Simulate `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active` states to debug state-based styles.

### 5. **Use DevTools' Layers Panel (Chrome)**

* Analyze stacking contexts and z-index issues.

### 6. **Leverage Inheritance and Cascade Visualization**

* Use the Computed tab to trace inherited and cascaded values.
* Spot overridden and inherited properties easily.

### 7. **Use Scroll Debugging Tools**

* Add `overflow: hidden/scroll/auto` to test scrolling behavior.
* Use DevTools' paint flashing to visualize layout shifts.

### 8. **Use Reduced Test Cases**

* Remove unrelated CSS/HTML to create a minimal bug reproduction case.
* Helps isolate the issue faster.

### 9. **Work With Media Queries Directly in DevTools**

* Use the responsive mode to test breakpoints.
* Adjust widths dynamically and observe applied styles.

### 10. **Enable Visual Debugging Tools or Extensions**

* Extensions like "CSS Peeper", "WhatRuns", or "VisBug" can simplify debugging.
* Some IDEs also show inline CSS warnings/errors.
