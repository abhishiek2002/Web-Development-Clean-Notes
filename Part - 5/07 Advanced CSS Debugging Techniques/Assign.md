1. You're inspecting a horizontal scrollbar on your webpage. Which is the most effective first step to identify the culprit?
2. A navbar overflows the viewport on mobile devices. You see display: flex and white-space: nowrap. What's the best debugging step?
3. Two flex children with fixed widths overflow their container. What does this most likely indicate?
4. You're debugging layout for screen widths below 600px. Which strategy is best?
