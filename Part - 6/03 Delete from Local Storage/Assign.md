## Background:

    In the previous task, you successfully stored multiple users in local storage using a unique key (such as an email or a timestamp). Now, we need to learn how to remove a specific user's details from local storage without affecting other users.



## Objective:

    This task requires you to use localStorage.removeItem() to delete a specific user's details using their unique key (email or timestamp).

## Deliverables:

    Delete a Specific User from Local Storage:
    When listing users, ensure each user has a unique key (email).
    Add a "Delete" button next to each userâ€™s details (Inside each li tag you create).


    When the button is clicked, remove that specific user's data from local storage.

    Ensure that after deletion, the user's details are also removed from the displayed list.


## Hint:

    localStorage.removeItem(key) takes one argument, which is the key to the item you want to remove.
    In this case, the key will be the email.
