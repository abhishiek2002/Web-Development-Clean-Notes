# Task: Create and Manage an EC2 Instance

## Tasks:

### 1. Create an EC2 Instance:

- Watch the video: [Create EC2 link](https://www.loom.com/share/b179b294b1784bdab6f55f72da6c6fca?sid=4560f5de-d97e-4d34-8627-dba8d08a94af)

- This video will guide you through the steps of creating an EC2 instance in AWS.

### Important Consideration:

- **Region Selection**: Choose a region close to your location (India) for optimal performance, such as Mumbai or Hyderabad.

### Learn about EC2 States and Termination:

- Watch the video: [EC2 Status link](https://www.loom.com/share/217546e48ee147b1b10048b16375dfce?sid=83b001cd-fdac-4c81-afcc-d0acd919449d)

- This video will explain the different states an EC2 instance can be in (e.g., pending, running, stopped, terminated).

**Key Point**: Terminate your EC2 instance when it's no longer needed to avoid unnecessary charges. The video will cover termination.

### Understanding EC2 Connection:

- Connecting to an EC2 instance is a separate task and the provided [video link EC2 Info and connection.](https://www.loom.com/share/7fe04b0b527843019c75e9459d521c78?sid=a09c89fa-1b11-4d5a-8c2d-ddccb3f8518f)

## Deliverables:

- Follow the steps in the videos to create an EC2 instance in the chosen region Mumbai.

- Understand the different EC2 instance states and the importance of termination for cost management.

- Connect to your EC2 instance.

- Answer the given question then proceed to the next task.



```
1. Why is it important to terminate your EC2 instance when it is no longer needed?

Answer Explanation

Explanation: Terminating an EC2 instance when it is no longer needed helps prevent incurring additional costs, ensuring you only pay for the resources you actively use.

2. What are the different states an EC2 instance can be in? (Select all that apply)

Answer Explanation

Explanation: An EC2 instance can be in various states such as running, pending, stopped, and terminated. The "archived" state does not apply to EC2 instances.

3. Why is it important to choose a region close to your location (e.g., Mumbai) when creating an EC2 instance?
