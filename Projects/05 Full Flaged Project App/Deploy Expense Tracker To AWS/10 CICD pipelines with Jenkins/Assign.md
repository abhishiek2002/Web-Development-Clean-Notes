- Once you have successfully hosted your Expense Tracker project, please include the hosted URL in your resume and in this document.

## Important Note:

After completing your demo test, please ensure you terminate all AWS resources, including:

- **EC2 Instances**: Stop and terminate all running EC2 instances.

- **RDS Instances**: Delete any RDS databases you created.

- **Related Services**: Terminate any other associated services such as RDS Subnet Groups, security groups, and any other resources you may have provisioned.

`Failure to terminate these resources within 30 days will result in ongoing charges to your AWS account.`

**Warning**: Never push your ".env" folder with AWS credentials into git.
```

**There are hackers who will misuse use credential, and we have had students who have gotten bills of 40$ in one day!!!**
