# ‚è≥ Debouncing in JavaScript (In Depth)

**Debouncing** is a performance optimization technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed. It is especially useful in situations where a function is triggered repeatedly in quick succession, like in scroll, resize, or keypress events.

---

## üìò What is Debouncing?

> **Debouncing** ensures that a function is executed only **once** after a specified **delay** from the **last time** it was called.

This helps avoid executing the function **too frequently**, which can lead to performance issues.

---

## üß† Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Typing in a Search Box

Without debouncing:

* API calls fire **every keystroke**

With debouncing:

* Waits until user **stops typing**, then fires API call

### Example 2: Window Resize Event

```js
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  console.log('Resizing...');
});
```

Every pixel movement triggers the event. With **debounce**, you execute logic **once** after the user stops resizing.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement Debounce Function

### ‚úÖ Basic Debounce Function (Step-by-step)

```js
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer; // a timer to keep track of the delay
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer); // Clear previous timer if function is called again

    // Set a new timer to run the function after 'delay' milliseconds
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

### ‚úÖ Simple Usage Example: Typing in Input Box

HTML:

```html
<input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Type something...">
```

JavaScript:

```js
function handleSearch() {
  console.log("Search function called");
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(handleSearch, 500);

document.getElementById("search").addEventListener("input", debouncedSearch);
```

üîç **Explanation:**

* `handleSearch` is the function we want to limit.
* `debouncedSearch` waits 500ms after user stops typing before executing.
* If the user types again within 500ms, the timer resets.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Debounce Works

1. The function is called repeatedly (like typing fast).
2. Each time, the **previous timer is cleared** using `clearTimeout()`.
3. A **new timer is set** with `setTimeout()`.
4. If no more function calls are made within `delay` ms, the function is finally executed.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Debouncing

* Reduces unnecessary function calls
* Improves performance
* Reduces API load
* Prevents UI lag during rapid actions

---

## ‚ùóWhen Not to Use Debouncing

* When **immediate feedback** is necessary
* For actions like clicking a button where **every click must be captured**

## üîÑ Debounce vs Throttle

| Feature  | Debounce                 | Throttle                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Delay function execution | Limit function calls to one per interval |
| Use Case | Search box, auto-save    | Scroll, mouse move, resize               |
| Trigger  | After delay (last event) | Every fixed time interval                |

---

## üßæ Summary

| Feature   | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Technique | Performance Optimization           |
| Core Idea | Delay execution after last event   |
| Benefit   | Avoids redundant executions        |
| Used For  | Input fields, resize, scroll, etc. |

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**Debouncing** is a great tool in JavaScript for **controlling high-frequency events** like typing or resizing. It helps in reducing API calls, improving app performance, and delivering a smoother user experience.

Use it wisely where you need to **delay execution** until an action is "settled."
