# 📦 Understanding `package.json`, `nodemon`, Dependencies and DevDependencies in Node.js

---

## 📄 What is `package.json`?

The `package.json` file is the **heart of any Node.js project**. It holds metadata relevant to the project and is used to manage the project’s dependencies, scripts, version, and more.

### 🧠 Purpose:

* Identifies the project name, version, and description.
* Lists dependencies and devDependencies.
* Contains scripts to automate tasks (like starting a server).
* Defines the entry point of the app (`main` field).

### 📝 Sample `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample Node.js app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.22"
  }
}
```

## 🔁 What is `nodemon`?

`nodemon` is a utility that **automatically restarts your Node.js server** whenever you make changes in your code files. It's commonly used during development to save time.

### ✅ Features:

* Watches files and restarts the app on changes.
* Great for development environments.
* Not recommended for production.

### 📦 Installing `nodemon`:

* **Globally** (useful from terminal anywhere):

  ```bash
  npm install -g nodemon
  ```
* **As a devDependency** (preferred for project-level use):

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  ```

## 📦 Dependencies vs DevDependencies

### ✅ Dependencies:

* These are **essential packages** required for the app to run in **production**.
* Installed via:

  ```bash
  npm install <package-name>
  ```
* Stored under the `dependencies` key in `package.json`.

### ✅ DevDependencies:

* These are packages used **only in development**, like testing tools, linters, bundlers, etc.
* Installed via:

  ```bash
  npm install <package-name> --save-dev
  ```
* Stored under `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

### 📋 Example:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^2.0.22",
  "eslint": "^8.0.0"
}
```

---

## 🚀 Best Practices:

* Always use `--save-dev` for tools like `nodemon`, `eslint`, `jest`, etc.
* Keep `package.json` organized and versioned properly.
* Use `scripts` to create shortcuts for running tasks.
* Use `npm install --production` on deployment to skip devDependencies.
