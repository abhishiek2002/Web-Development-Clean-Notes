In this task, you will be working with a CSS compiler. We have already provided the HTML structure, and your job is to apply CSS styles using different CSS selectors.

ðŸ“Œ Watch the ðŸŽ¥ basic selectors here .  https://www.loom.com/share/ff31d054208f4fdcbc6b22ee4663c2b6?sid=021a5e6b-61a6-4018-9a41-d5872a25c2e7


What You Will Learn:
```
You will focus on the following types of CSS selectors:

Universal Selector (*) â€“ Applies styles to all elements.
Element Selector (tagname) â€“ Targets specific HTML tags like h1, p, div, etc.
Class Selector (.classname) â€“ Targets elements with a specific class.
ID Selector (#idname) â€“ Targets elements with a unique ID.
```

Deliverables : 
```
Your task is to add CSS styles to the elements based on their selectors.



Apply the following styles to all elements (Universal Selector *):

font-family: Arial,sans-serif;


Select the highlight class (.highlight):

background-color: yellow;
color: red;


Select the unique ID (#unique) and apply the following styles:

color: dark green;
background-color: light blue;


Select all h2 elements (Element Selector h2) and apply the following styles:

text-align: center;
color: blue;


Select all p elements (Element Selector p) and apply the following styles:

font-size: 18px;
line-height: 1.5;
```

Note:
```
Remove the commented lines and add the styles.
Use the exact names (.highlight, #unique, h2, p) as suggested in the instructions.
Focus only on writing the correct CSS rules.
```



The final output will be somewhat like this image:

```css
* { 
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.highlight { 
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
} 

#unique { 
    color: darkgreen;
    background-color: lightblue;
} 

h2 { 
    text-align: center;
    color: blue;
} 

p { 
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 1.5;
}
```






Once done, you should see the expected styles applied correctly. Happy coding! ðŸš€
