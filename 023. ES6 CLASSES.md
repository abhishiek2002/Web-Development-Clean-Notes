Convert all the features present in the functional contructor of Student into Student class . Best Design pattern to follow





Complete the Puzzle
```md
Create a constructor function Student which takes in first name, last name , roll number and Student's age to initialize the object
Complete the function printFullName() so that it prints the full name of the student object which invokes it.
Complete the function minorOrmajor() so that it
prints major if the student's age is above or equal to 18
prints minor if the student's age is below 18
Make 2 students objects.Ram and Yash to test everything
Yash's details: ('yash', 'prasad', 12, 27)
Ram's details: ('ram', 'prasad', 14, 15)
Invoke prinFullName and minorOrmajor to print Yash's and Ram's details.


If stuck for more than 1 hour check the hints.



Output should look like the following.(Output is case sensitive )

yashprasad

Major

ramprasad

Minor
```

```js
class Student {
    constructor(firstName, lastName , rollNumber , age) {
        //complete this function to initialize the object
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    printFullName() {
        //complete this function to print the full Name of the student object invoking the method
        console.log(`${this.firstName}${this.lastName}`)

    }
    
    minorOrMajor(){
       //If age greater than 18 print Major
       //if age less than 18 print Minor
       //Complete this function
        if (this.age < 18) {
            console.log("Minor");
        } else {
            console.log("Major");
        }
    }
}
function createNewStudents(){
    //create 2 object Yash and Ram with initial values as mentioned in question
    var s1 = new Student("yash", "prasad", 12, 27);
    var s2 = new Student("ram", "prasad", 14, 15);

    //Print yash's full name by invoking printFullName()   
    s1.printFullName();

    //Print whether yash is minor or major by invoking minorOrMajor function
    s1.minorOrMajor();

   //Print Rams's full name by invoking printFullName()  
    s2.printFullName();

    //Print whether Ram is minor or major by invoking minorOrMajor function
    s2.minorOrMajor();
}
```
