Deliverables
```md
Every time a new user registers, keep a count of number of registered users.
At any given point of time if we invoke printNumberOfUsers ,the number of users should get printed .
Complete the coding puzzle. It is very easy.
```

```js
class User{
    
    //initialize a  static variable
    static count;
    
    constructor(username, email, password) {
        //Complete the constructor function and
        //  also keep a count of total users created
        this.username = username;
        this.email = email;
        this.password = password;
        count += 1;
    }
    printNumberOfUsers(){
        //console log the total number of users in the same format as in output
        console.log(`currentnumberofusers = ${count}`);
    }
    

}

User:count = 0;

function createNewStudents(){
    const yash = new User("yash", "yash@gmail.com", '100000xbasbcjsa');
    yash.printNumberOfUsers()
    const user2 = new User("vaibhav", "vaibhav@gmail.com", '2cs0');
    user2.printNumberOfUsers()
    yash.printNumberOfUsers()

}
```
