To make our website dynamic in nature we need a backend. But currently we do not know how to make backend API endpoints.

What do we do now?

We can make use of [crudcrud.com](https://crudcrud.com/) which provides us a backend REST API for free.

Deliverables:

    Make a POST request to crud-crud via POSTMAN.
    Now, get the object you posted to crud-crud by making a GET request to crud-crud via POSTMAN.
    Now, change email id of the object by making a PUT request to crud-crud via POSTMAN.
    Now, delete the object from crud-crud by making a DELETE request via POSTMAN.
