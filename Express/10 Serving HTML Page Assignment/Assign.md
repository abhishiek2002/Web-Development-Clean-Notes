# Get request with HTML
    Now that you are comfortable working with HTML and integrating it with controllers.
    Your task is to serve the html file.

## Deliverables:
    Your mission is to build a Node.js application that serves an HTML file in response to a GET request.

    Set up a server using express.
    Add a GET endpoint (e.g., /api/products) to handle GET requests.
    Use res.sendFile() to serve an HTML file from your project directory inside folder VIEW.
    Return a form with following attributes:
    Form Structure:

    The form should contain a label with the text "Product Name".
    The label's for attribute and the input's id attribute should both be set to product for consistency and accessibility.
    The form should include an input field where users can enter the product name. The input field should have the name attribute set to productName.
    The form should contain a submit button with the content "Add Product".

    Keep your project organized and fun to explore!

    Also try to run the given setup on VS Code on your system and once approved push your code to GitHub.

# POST request with HTML

## Deliverables 2:

    Create a server using express.
    Serve a form using a GET request.
    Use Axios to send a POST request from the form, allowing users to add products to the server.
    Return the user-added product as a response and console.log the data on the server.
    Test your application using Postman to ensure everything works as expected.


    By the end, youâ€™ll have a fully functional setup for working with POST requests and handling user data dynamically.
