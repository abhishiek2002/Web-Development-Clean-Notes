    In this task, you will learn how to use Express Router to organize and structure your routes efficiently. Instead of defining all routes in a single file, Express Router helps you break them into separate modules, making your code cleaner and more manageable.

üìΩÔ∏è Watch the following video:

Deliverables:
    Watch the video carefully to understand how routers work in Express.
    Implement Express Router in your project, moving routes to a separate file as done in the video.
    Use app.use() to connect the router to your main server file.
    Test your routes using Postman or the browser to ensure everything works correctly.

üí° Why is this important?
