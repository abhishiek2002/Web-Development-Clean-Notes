Build Your Own Library System with Express.js!

    Congratulations! Youâ€™re now ready to build your own Express.js application. This task will help you apply what youâ€™ve learned about routes, HTTP methods, and Express Router by creating a simple library management system.

ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?

    This project will give you hands-on experience with handling API requests, structuring routes properly, and testing endpoints, all of which are crucial skills for backend development!

Deliverables:

    1.Set Up the Server

    Use Express.js to create a server.

    2.Create the Routes (API Endpoints) You need to create these routes:(Make sure you are using router for this)

    GET /books: Print a message and send a response like "Here is the list of books!".
    POST /books: Print the book data sent in the request and send a message like "Book has been added!".

    3.Test Your API

    Use Postman or any API testing tool to test your endpoints.
    Ensure that GET requests return the correct message and POST requests log the received data.
